      "British companies now pay 46% higher industrial electricity prices than IEA average. Discover how Eden helps businesses maintain competitiveness.",
    longContent: `<p className="card-text mb-3">
  British companies are now paying some of the highest industrial electricity prices in the world — 46% above the average across other International Energy Agency (IEA) countries. According to <em>The Times</em> (April 2024), this cost disparity is forcing many large manufacturers and energy-intensive businesses to rethink their long-term plans in the UK.
</p>
<p className="card-text">
  Some, like CF Fertilisers, have shut down production lines entirely. Others are delaying investment, pausing growth, or looking abroad for more energy-competitive markets. Energy is no longer just a utility — it's a key strategic risk for large and medium-sized businesses.
</p>
<p className="card-text">
  Industrial leaders and trade groups like Make UK warn that additional policy and network charges unique to the UK are compounding the issue, leaving British firms less competitive. While government relief schemes such as the Energy Bills Discount Scheme exist, many businesses report that they fall short of what’s needed.

    sub_title: "Navigating the hidden costs of AI infrastructure expansion",
    content:
      "Global data center electricity demand expected to double by 2030. Learn how Eden helps balance AI growth with sustainable energy strategies.",
    longContent: `<p className="card-text mb-3">
  The growth of Artificial Intelligence is reshaping industries — and with it, reshaping the energy landscape. Behind the headlines of breakthroughs and innovation lies a harder truth: AI consumes serious power. And as demand for data processing accelerates, so does pressure on already stretched energy infrastructure.
</p>

<p className="card-text">
  According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity use by data centres is expected to more than double by 2030, reaching an estimated 945 terawatt-hours (TWh) — more than the entire current electricity consumption of Japan.
</p>

<p className="card-text">
  In the UK, this shift is being felt sharply. As AI-driven infrastructure expands, data centres are placing unprecedented demands on the grid. Some developers are even turning to gas-fired generators to bypass grid delays, raising concerns about climate targets being sidelined to meet commercial urgency.
</p>

<p className="card-text">
  In fact, large-scale AI models — such as the one that powers platforms like ChatGPT — can require as much as 42 gigawatt-hours (GWh) just for training. That’s equivalent to the annual energy use of over 10,000 UK homes.
</p>

<h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">UK Grid Capacity Is Being Tested — and So Are Business Strategies</h5>
<p className="card-text">
  The issue isn’t just the scale of energy demand — it’s the speed. In advanced economies, data centres are expected to account for over 20% of electricity demand growth by 2030. In the U.S., they could outpace the entire manufacturing sector in energy use within the decade.
</p>

<p className="card-text">
  Closer to home, the UK government’s ambition to increase AI computing capacity twentyfold by 2030 raises urgent questions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can our grid infrastructure keep up with demand?</li>
  <li>Can AI growth remain aligned with net-zero targets?</li>
  <li>And where does this leave large and medium-sized enterprises competing for stable, sustainable energy supply?</li>
</ul>

<p className="card-text">
  The truth is, AI’s rise has made electricity a strategic asset. And as always, when the market shifts, businesses need to shift with it — quickly and intelligently.

</p>

<h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">The UK Grid Is Getting a Massive Upgrade</h5>
<p className="card-text">
  The UK’s electricity grid is undergoing the most significant upgrade in generations. Behind the shift lies a simple fact: the energy demands of the future will not be met with the infrastructure of the past.
</p>

<p className="card-text">
  Between the rapid growth in renewable energy, the surge in electricity consumption from sectors like AI and data centres, and the transition to electric vehicles and heat pumps, pressure on the national grid has never been higher.
</p>

<p className="card-text">
  In response, the National Grid has launched a record £35 billion investment programme known as the Great Grid Upgrade — a comprehensive initiative that will double the UK's transmission capacity by 2035. This includes 17 major new infrastructure projects, grid reinforcements, and system enhancements designed to support the transition to net zero <span className="text-muted">[National Grid, 2024]</span>.
</p>

<h6 className="fw-bold mt-4">Big Plans — and Even Bigger Challenges</h6>
<p className="card-text">
  Among the flagship projects is the Eastern Green Link: a £4.3 billion subsea cable that will run between Scotland and England. Once live in 2029, it’s expected to transmit enough green electricity to power over two million homes. It’s an essential piece of the UK’s renewable strategy — moving wind-generated electricity from the north of the country to where demand is highest in the south and midlands <span className="text-muted">[The Guardian, Aug 2024]</span>.
</p>

<p className="card-text">
  But the infrastructure rollout hasn’t been without issues. According to recent industry analysis, there is currently over £200 billion worth of renewable energy projects stuck in a grid connection queue. For businesses planning new facilities, electrification programmes, or net-zero transitions, this creates uncertainty — and delay.
</p>

<p className="card-text">
  The UK government has acknowledged the bottleneck and responded with a strategic energy infrastructure plan to 2050, focusing on grid flexibility, smart systems, offshore wind, and hydrogen readiness. It’s ambitious, but implementation is key <span className="text-muted">[Energy News, 2024]</span>.
</p>

<h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">What This Means for Businesses</h5>
<p className="card-text">
  This grid overhaul will directly affect large and medium-sized enterprises — particularly those with high energy consumption, growing data and infrastructure needs, or aggressive sustainability goals.
</p>

<p className="card-text">
  For many, questions are starting to surface:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Will my business have access to enough power — at the right time and price?</li>
  <li>Should we wait for connection upgrades, or act now with onsite or distributed energy?</li>
  <li>How do I plan energy procurement when infrastructure and policy are both in flux?</li>
